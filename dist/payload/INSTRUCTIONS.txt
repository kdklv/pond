PondTV Simple Setup
===================

To install PondTV on your Raspberry Pi:

1. Flash a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) image to your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.
   (In the imager settings, it's a good idea to set a hostname and enable SSH).

2. Copy all the files from this 'payload' directory to the 'boot' partition of the SD card.

3. The Raspberry Pi MUST be connected to the internet for the first boot to download 'mpv'.

4. Eject the SD card, put it in your Raspberry Pi, and power it on.

The Pi will boot, install everything automatically, and then reboot. After this, the internet is no longer required.
